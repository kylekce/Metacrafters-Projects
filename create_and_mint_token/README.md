## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the code from the [holocoin.sol](https://github.com/kylekce/Metacrafters-Projects/blob/main/create_and_mint_token/contracts/holocoin.sol) file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to a compatible version, and then click on the Compile button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the mint function to add specific number of tokens to the supply, burn function to burn a specific number of tokens, or transfer function to send tokens to another address. Once you filled the address and value in your chosen function, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and you'll see a message from the console.
